# Xcode Development

- Prefer Swift over Objective-C for new code
- Use modern Swift concurrency (async/await) over completion handlers
- Prefer SwiftUI for new UI, UIKit when needed
- Use `let` over `var` whenever possible
- Prefer value types (structs, enums) over classes
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines for naming
- Use `[weak self]` in closures to avoid retain cycles
- Write unit tests with XCTest
- Use the xcodeproj MCP server tools to modify Xcode projects and workspaces
